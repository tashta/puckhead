Puckhead
===========

http://puckhead.nodejitsu.com

Puckhead is a multiplayer air hockey game where you can control a mallet by moving your head in front of a webcam. It was created in collaboration with Andreas Nauleau, Coleman Foley and Howard Tang.

We used node.js, express.js, socket.io, box2d, headtrackr.js and raphael.js.

I worked on game physics and graphics as well as on the website styling.
